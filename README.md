# Express.js Backend README Template

A well-structured `README.md` is crucial for any project, especially for backend services. It serves as the primary documentation for developers who want to understand, set up, and contribute to your Express.js application.

This template provides a comprehensive structure for your `README.md` file. Remember to replace the placeholder content (`[Your Project Name]`, `[Description]`, etc.) with your project's specific details.

## ✨ Features

* [List the key features of your backend application. For example:]
    * User authentication (Registration, Login, JWT-based authentication)
    * CRUD operations for [Resource Name] (e.g., Products, Posts, Users)
    * Data validation
    * Error handling
    * API rate limiting
    * [Any other significant features]

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Node.js**: Runtime environment
* **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
* **[Database Name]** ([e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL]): Database system
    * **[ORM/ODM Name]** ([e.g., Mongoose, Sequelize, Prisma]): Object-Relational Mapper / Object-Document Mapper (if applicable)
* **[Authentication Library]** ([e.g., Passport.js, bcrypt.js, jsonwebtoken]): For authentication and authorization
* **[Validation Library]** ([e.g., Joi, Express-Validator]): For input validation
* **[Testing Framework]** ([e.g., Jest, Mocha, Chai, Supertest]): For unit/integration testing
* **[Other Libraries]** ([e.g., Dotenv, Morgan, Helmet, CORS]): Any other significant libraries
* **[Deployment Platform]** ([e.g., Heroku, AWS EC2, Vercel, Render]): Where the application is deployed (if applicable)

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed (LTS version recommended).
    * You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.
* **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**: Usually comes with Node.js.
* **[Database Client/Server]**: If you're using a local database, ensure it's installed and running (e.g., MongoDB Community Server, PostgreSQL).

## 🚀 Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section).

4.  **Database Setup (if applicable):**
    * [Instructions on how to set up your database, e.g., create a database, run migrations, seed data.]
    * Example for MongoDB: Ensure your MongoDB instance is running.
    * Example for SQL databases:
        ```bash
        # If using Sequelize with migrations
        npx sequelize db:migrate
        # If you have seeders
        npx sequelize db:seed:all
        ```

## 🏃 Usage

### Running the Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# OR
npm run dev # If you have a separate dev script (e.g., using nodemon)
# OR
yarn start
# OR
yarn dev
```

The server will typically run on `http://localhost:[PORT]`, where `[PORT]` is defined in your `.env` file (e.g., `3000`, `5000`).

### API Endpoints

Here's a list of the main API endpoints. You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl` to test them.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:[PORT]/api/v1` (adjust as per your routing)

| Method | Endpoint                    | Description                                        | Authentication Required | Request Body (Example) |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `POST` | `/auth/register`            | Register a new user                                | No                      | `{"username": "testuser", "email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}` |
